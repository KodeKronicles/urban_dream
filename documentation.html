                            <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p>Urban Dream is a digital exhibition that dives into some of the most radical, ambitious, and sometimes outright impossible architectural ideas. It is a space where unbuilt cities, speculative projects, and experimental urban concepts are brought together to show how architecture is not just about constructing buildings but about imagining new ways of living.</p>
        <p>The project was developed as part of the "Information Modeling and Web Technologies" course in the Master's Degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge at the University of Bologna, under the supervision of Professor Fabio Vitali. It is the result of a collaborative effort between Alisa Antonova, Elena Binotti, and Hubert Krzywonos, combining digital curation, interactive design, and historical research to create an accessible and engaging platform.</p>
        
        <h2>What Urban Dream Is About</h2>
        <p>The exhibition is built around the idea that some of the most fascinating architectural projects never made it past the concept stage. Some were too ambitious, others too utopian, and many were simply ahead of their time. These "unbuilt cities" still play a huge role in shaping architectural discourse, influencing later designs, and sparking debates about how we should build and inhabit our environments.</p>
        <p>Urban Dream brings together a selection of these visionary projects, organizing them into different narratives that help make sense of their historical, spatial, and conceptual significance. It is not just a collection of random futuristic buildings; instead, it follows a clear structure that allows visitors to explore architecture through different lenses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>By Space</b> → How geography, environment, and spatial constraints shape urban design</li>
            <li><b>By Time</b> → How architectural ideas evolve and respond to historical changes</li>
            <li><b>By Reality</b> → Distinguishing between pure speculation and projects that have actually been built (or partially realized)</li>
            <li><b>By Context</b> → How architecture interacts with urbanism, artistic intervention, radical housing, and technology</li>
            <li><b>By Ideals</b> → Exploring the philosophical and ideological principles behind these projects, from utopian dreams to dystopian warnings</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This thematic structure is what makes Urban Dream more than just an archive—it is an interactive research tool that allows users to navigate and compare projects in a meaningful way.</p>
        
        <h2>The Selection of Items</h2>
        <p>The projects featured in Urban Dream were chosen based on their historical impact, conceptual strength, and relevance to contemporary architectural discussions. We wanted to showcase designs that push boundaries, challenge conventions, and make us rethink the way we build cities. The selection includes both well-known classics and lesser-known experimental works.</p>
        <p>For example, we included Walking City by Archigram, a vision of a mobile, self-sustaining city that could move across landscapes like a giant machine. This idea, though never built, reflects a deep fascination with technology and adaptability in urbanism. Similarly, Plan Voisin by Le Corbusier presents an extreme modernist vision that would have demolished half of historic Paris to make way for towering skyscrapers—an idea that was radical and controversial but influenced many later urban developments.</p>
        <p>We also included more recent concepts, such as The Line, a hyper-dense linear city currently under development in Saudi Arabia, which embodies both the promise and the ethical concerns of futuristic urban planning. On the other hand, projects like Torre David, an unfinished skyscraper in Caracas turned into a self-organized community, show how buildings can take on new, unexpected lives beyond their original intentions.</p>
        <p>Beyond these famous examples, we also wanted to highlight experimental and artistic projects, like Oase No. 7, an inflatable structure that redefines public space, and Wrapped Reichstag, a temporary transformation of a historic building into an ephemeral artwork. These examples show how architecture can be more than just functional—it can also be a medium for political and artistic expression.</p>
        
        <h2>Why a Digital Exhibition?</h2>
        <p>One of the key aspects of Urban Dream is that it exists entirely in a digital space. This is not just a necessity but a deliberate choice. Many of the projects we feature were never meant to be physically realized, and in some cases, they only exist as sketches, collages, or theoretical writings. A digital format allows us to bring these ideas to life in new ways, using maps, animations, and interactive filtering to explore them dynamically.</p>
        <p>Instead of a traditional museum exhibit, where visitors walk through physical spaces, Urban Dream encourages exploration through thematic categories, spatial mapping, and timeline-based navigation. This structure allows for a non-linear, immersive experience, where users can approach the projects from multiple angles and see connections between different architectural visions.</p>
        
        <h2>What We Learned</h2>
        <p>Developing this exhibition made us reflect on the role of unbuilt architecture and how it influences real-world urban planning. We realized that even projects that seem impractical or impossible have a way of shaping future designs. Many of the ideas explored in the exhibition—such as modular housing, floating cities, or high-tech infrastructures—are now being revisited in contemporary urban planning as solutions to climate change, housing crises, and technological shifts.</p>
        <p>Urban Dream is a tribute to radical imagination in architecture, a way to celebrate the boldest ideas that challenged conventions and redefined what cities could be. Through this digital platform, we aim to make these concepts accessible to a wider audience, encouraging curiosity and discussion about the future of urban life.</p>

                    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="structure">
                        <div class="info-section">
                            <h1>Content Structure</h1>
        <p>Urban Dream is designed as an interactive digital exhibition, structured to provide users with multiple entry points into the world of speculative and visionary architecture. Rather than a linear presentation, the website offers a dynamic and exploratory approach, allowing visitors to engage with projects based on their thematic, historical, and spatial significance. The content is carefully organized to balance accessibility with depth, ensuring that both casual visitors and more dedicated researchers can navigate the exhibition in a way that suits their interests.</p>
        
        <h2>Site Architecture and Navigation</h2>
        <p>The website is divided into several key sections, each serving a distinct function within the broader narrative of the exhibition. The homepage acts as an introductory portal, immediately immersing users in the visual and conceptual world of Urban Dream. A flowing grid animation presents a curated selection of projects, establishing the idea that architecture is constantly evolving, even when it remains unbuilt. Below this, the homepage provides an overview of the exhibition's themes, a historical timeline, and practical information about the project.</p>
        <p>From here, users can navigate to the exhibition section, which is the core of the experience. This page is structured around thematic categories rather than a chronological or geographical arrangement. The exhibition is broken down into five distinct narratives—Space, Time, Reality, Context, and Ideals—each representing a different way of understanding architectural experimentation. These categories allow visitors to explore projects through different conceptual frameworks, emphasizing the interconnectedness of ideas across disciplines and time periods.</p>
        <p>The map page introduces a spatial dimension to the exhibition, placing projects within a geographic framework. Users can explore how visionary ideas have emerged in different locations, from European modernist experiments to futuristic urban visions in the Middle East and beyond. The interactive interface enables filtering by project type, status (built or unbuilt), and contextual categories, making it an engaging tool for comparative analysis.</p>
        <p>The items page provides a detailed database of individual projects, acting as an archive where users can explore each architectural concept in depth. This section includes high-resolution images, descriptive texts, contextual analysis, and cross-references to related projects. The layout is designed to be intuitive, with filtering and sorting functions that allow users to search by year, category, or conceptual theme.</p>
        <p>The about page serves as a meta-narrative, explaining the project's research methodology, curatorial approach, and development process. It also provides background on the team behind Urban Dream, offering transparency on how the exhibition was conceived and assembled.</p>
        
        <h2>Interactive Features and User Experience</h2>
        <p>Urban Dream is built to encourage exploration, integrating several interactive elements that make navigation fluid and engaging. Thematic tabs and filters enable users to quickly switch between different perspectives, ensuring that they can move seamlessly between broad conceptual frameworks and specific projects. The site also incorporates dynamic sorting mechanisms, particularly in the items and map sections, allowing for a customized research experience.</p>
        <p>A major emphasis is placed on visual storytelling. Instead of relying solely on text-based descriptions, the exhibition makes extensive use of imagery, animations, and interactive elements to communicate architectural concepts. The use of a carousel system in the exhibition section allows users to preview projects within each thematic category before diving into detailed pages.</p>
        <p>The historical timeline presents a chronological overview of key moments in speculative urbanism, providing users with historical context while maintaining an interactive format. By scrolling through different eras, visitors can see how architectural visions have evolved in response to cultural, technological, and political shifts.</p>
        <p>Another crucial feature is the SVG-based interactive map, which offers a spatial approach to navigation. Users can explore projects based on their geographic distribution, revealing patterns in architectural experimentation across different regions. This map is particularly useful for understanding the global dimensions of speculative architecture, highlighting how similar ideas have emerged in different cultural contexts.</p>
        
        <h2>Content Accessibility and Structuring</h2>
        <p>One of the primary goals of Urban Dream is to make complex architectural ideas accessible to a broad audience. The content is structured in a way that allows for multiple levels of engagement, catering to both general visitors and those with a deeper academic interest in architecture.</p>
        <p>Each project page follows a consistent format, ensuring that users can easily compare different items. The structure includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A short introduction that summarizes the project's key idea</li>
            <li>A visual section with curated images or diagrams</li>
            <li>A contextual analysis explaining the project's historical and conceptual relevance</li>
            <li>Cross-references to related projects, encouraging further exploration</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additionally, the website's design choices enhance readability and usability. The typography, color scheme, and spacing are optimized for clarity, while interactive elements provide additional layers of information without overwhelming the user. The filtering and sorting functions ensure that users can find specific projects efficiently, while the modular layout allows for future expansion of the exhibition.</p>

                            <h1>Design Elements</h1>
        <p>Urban Dream is built around a strong visual identity that makes the experience both aesthetically compelling and functionally intuitive. The project's design choices reinforce its core themes: radical urban visions, speculative architecture, and the intersection of history and the future. Every layout decision, typography selection, and color scheme contributes to a sense of immersion, creating a space where users can explore ideas beyond the physical limits of traditional exhibitions.</p>
        
        <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
<p>
The visual identity of Urban Dream originated from a deliberately minimal design approach. We wanted the interface to feel clean, bold, and unobtrusive, allowing the content—the speculative architectural visions—to take center stage. The deep red was chosen as a monolithic, almost ideological color, evoking strength, urgency, and radical imagination. This restrained aesthetic—anchored in geometric structure, generous white space, and limited distractions—reflects the exhibition's conceptual foundation: a space where ideas speak louder than decoration.
</p>

        <h2>Typography and Colors</h2>
        <p>One of the first things that stands out in Urban Dream is its bold use of typography. The project primarily employs two fonts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Inter</strong> → A clean, modern sans-serif font that ensures readability across different screen sizes. It is used for the majority of the text, including body content and navigation.</li>
            <li><strong>Futura Maxi CG Bold</strong> → A geometric and striking typeface used for headings and key elements. It reflects the project's futuristic and architectural aesthetic while adding a distinctive character to titles.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The color palette is intentionally limited but powerful. The dominant shade is deep red (#D02E02), used for headings, buttons, and interactive elements. Red has been chosen for its association with boldness, revolution, and avant-garde ideas, all of which are central to the themes of the exhibition. To balance this intensity, the background remains predominantly white, while black and gray tones provide contrast and enhance readability.</p>
        <p>The hover effects subtly reinforce the visual style without overwhelming the user. Instead of drastic color shifts, elements become slightly darker or gain a subtle underline when interacted with, maintaining consistency across the design.</p>
        
        <h2>Layout and Navigation</h2>
        <p>Urban Dream follows a clean grid-based structure, optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing. The entire website is designed to prioritize exploration, with each section leading naturally to the next.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The homepage presents a mix of images and text, encouraging users to dive into the content. A scrolling background grid of images subtly reinforces the theme of constant movement and evolution in urban design.</li>
            <li>The exhibition section is divided into five categories (Space, Time, Reality, Context, Ideals), allowing users to explore projects based on different perspectives. A carousel system lets users preview projects before selecting one to examine in more detail.</li>
            <li>The map section transforms static architectural concepts into a geographical experience, allowing users to see how speculative ideas are distributed across the world. The map is interactive, and clicking on different locations filters the projects accordingly.</li>
            <li>The items section follows a structured catalog format, displaying each project with a detailed description, related images, and a clear categorization system.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Navigation is kept simple and efficient. The navbar remains fixed at the top for easy access, while dropdown menus provide filtering options without cluttering the interface. Buttons and interactive elements are large and well-spaced, ensuring usability across different devices.</p>
        
        <h2>Image and Multimedia Use</h2>
        <p>Visual content plays a crucial role in Urban Dream, given that architecture is inherently a visual discipline. The project incorporates a mix of archival images, concept sketches, 3D renders, and diagrams, all chosen to provide deeper insight into each project.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The homepage's flowing image grid serves as an introduction, showcasing various projects in a continuous motion that suggests urban evolution.</li>
            <li>Each project page includes high-resolution images that expand when clicked, allowing users to examine details closely.</li>
            <li>The interactive map integrates SVG-based mapping, making it both responsive and scalable. This ensures that users can zoom and explore different areas without losing image quality.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Animation is used selectively to enhance engagement without overwhelming the experience. Smooth fade-ins and transitions make navigation feel fluid, while the parallax scrolling effects in the timeline section create a sense of depth.</p>
        
        <h2>Cards and Interactive Elements</h2>
        <p>The project cards are one of the most carefully designed components of the site. They are used extensively in the exhibition and items sections, providing a compact yet information-rich preview of each architectural vision. Each card contains:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A project image, ensuring visual engagement</li>
            <li>A title and category label, allowing users to quickly understand the project's theme</li>
            <li>A subtle hover effect, reinforcing the interactive nature of the site</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To maintain readability and consistency, card layouts automatically adjust based on screen size, ensuring they remain clear and accessible on mobile devices. The CSS ensures that all images within cards maintain a fixed aspect ratio, preventing distortion and preserving the original composition of architectural drawings and concept art.</p>
        
        <h2>Responsive Design and Accessibility</h2>
        <p>Urban Dream is designed to be fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes and resolutions. The use of flexbox and CSS grid layouts allows content to reflow dynamically, ensuring an optimal experience on both large desktop monitors and small mobile screens.</p>
        <p>Several media queries fine-tune the layout:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>On smaller screens, the nav menu collapses into a mobile-friendly dropdown, while project cards stack vertically for better readability</li>
            <li>Font sizes and margins are adjusted to prevent overcrowding on compact displays</li>
            <li>The timeline section, which is horizontally structured on larger screens, transforms into a vertical format on mobile for easier scrolling</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Accessibility is also taken into consideration:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>High contrast between text and background colors ensures readability</li>
            <li>Keyboard navigation is fully supported, allowing users to explore the site without relying on a mouse</li>
            <li>ARIA attributes are integrated where needed, improving compatibility with screen readers</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Buttons, Links, and Hover Effects</h2>
        <p>One of the key design principles of Urban Dream is that everything that can be interacted with should feel interactive. This means that buttons and links have clear visual feedback when hovered or clicked.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Links are underlined and change color slightly when hovered</li>
            <li>Buttons follow a simple yet bold style, using red with white text to maintain contrast</li>
            <li>Sort and filter buttons in the items section are highlighted when active, helping users track their selections</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The dropdown menus for filtering projects maintain a minimalist style, appearing only when needed and disappearing smoothly to avoid distractions.</p>
        
        <h2>Final Thoughts on Design</h2>
        <p>The design of Urban Dream is meant to reflect the essence of the exhibition itself: a place where futuristic visions, experimental ideas, and historical narratives come together. By combining bold typography, a structured layout, carefully chosen imagery, and smooth interactivity, the project creates a digital experience that is both visually striking and easy to navigate.</p>
        <p>More than just a website, it functions as a research and discovery tool, giving users the freedom to explore radical architecture in their own way. The combination of strong graphic identity, intuitive navigation, and interactive elements ensures that Urban Dream is not just a repository of information, but an engaging space where speculative architecture comes to life.</p>

                    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="logo">
                        <div class="info-section">
                            <h1>The Logo</h1>
        <h2>The Urban Dream Logo: A Human at the Center of the City</h2>
        <p>The Urban Dream logo is a bold, minimalist representation of the relationship between humans and the city. Its design can be seen as a stylized human figure, represented by the central opening, surrounded by concentric rings that symbolize the layered structure of an urban environment. This creates a strong visual metaphor: the city is not just a collection of buildings but a space shaped by human presence, movement, and interaction.</p>
        
        <h2>The City as Layers Around the Individual</h2>
        <p>The circular structure gives a sense of enclosure, suggesting the way cities surround and define the people who inhabit them. The rings can be interpreted as different layers of urban life—infrastructure, communities, or even the evolving history of a place. They also evoke ideas of movement and expansion, reinforcing the notion that architecture and urban planning are in constant transformation.</p>
        
        <h2>The Open Passage and Accessibility</h2>
        <p>A key feature of the logo is the open gap at the bottom, which interrupts the otherwise perfect circular form. This detail is significant because it suggests a gateway, a passage into the city, or even an invitation to explore. It breaks the idea of a closed system and instead emphasizes accessibility, interaction, and openness to change—values that align with the speculative and visionary nature of the exhibition.</p>
        
        <h2>Minimalist and Modernist Aesthetic</h2>
        <p>The simplicity of the design reflects a modernist and functional approach, keeping the visual identity of Urban Dream clean, impactful, and easy to recognize. The contrast between the rigid, geometric structure and the organic concept of human presence reinforces the idea that the city is both a designed space and a lived experience.</p>
        
        <h2>Color Choice and Symbolism</h2>
        <p>The deep red background and stark white lines create a strong visual impact, making the logo highly recognizable. Red is often associated with boldness, transformation, and radical thought, making it an ideal choice for an exhibition focused on avant-garde and speculative architecture. The use of white against red enhances clarity and contrast, ensuring that the message of the logo is immediate and striking.</p>
        
        <h2>A Conceptual Gateway to the Exhibition</h2>
        <p>The Urban Dream logo is more than just a visual identity—it acts as a conceptual gateway to the themes of the exhibition. It encapsulates the core ideas of human interaction with urban space, the layered complexity of cities, and the continuous transformation of architecture. It is a symbol of exploration, where the city is not seen as a static entity but as a space of possibility, innovation, and future visions.</p>

        <p>One of the most important interactive features of Urban Dream is the ability to filter and sort architectural projects based on different criteria. This system is implemented in the items section and works through JavaScript functions that dynamically update the displayed content based on user selections.</p>
        <p>Users can filter projects by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Status (Unbuilt, Built)</li>
            <li>Context (Urbanism, Artistic Intervention, Radical Living, Tech Infrastructure)</li>
            <li>Ideals (Utopian, Dystopian, Innovation, Deconstruction)</li>
            <li>Time Period (Before 2000, After 2000)</li>
            <li>Geographic Space (Europe, Asia, America, Global)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The filtering works in real-time: when a user selects a filter, the list of projects updates instantly without needing a page refresh. This is achieved through event listeners that detect when a filter is clicked and dynamically modify the visibility of certain items.</p>
        <p>Sorting is another key functionality. Users can sort projects alphabetically, by year, or by category, thanks to a JavaScript function that rearranges table rows or grid items dynamically. The sorting mechanism updates the table structure in the items section, ensuring that projects are displayed in a logical order based on user preference.</p>
        
        <h2>Interactive Map Navigation</h2>
        <p>The map page is one of the most unique features of Urban Dream, allowing users to explore projects in a spatial context. Instead of just reading about radical architecture, users can see where these concepts were developed, debated, or imagined.</p>
        <p>The map is implemented using SVG elements combined with JavaScript event listeners that make different parts of the map clickable and interactive. When a user clicks on a map marker, the corresponding project details are dynamically displayed. Additionally, the map allows for category-based filtering, meaning users can view only unbuilt projects, futuristic utopias, or projects from specific regions.</p>
        <p>To keep the interaction smooth, JavaScript ensures that hover effects, popups, and zooming work efficiently. When a user hovers over a project marker, additional details appear, giving a quick overview without requiring a full page reload.</p>
        
        <h2>Toggle Information and Expanding Project Descriptions</h2>
        <p>Another interactive element of the site is the toggle feature, which allows users to reveal more information about a project by clicking a "+" icon. This functionality is essential for maintaining a clean layout while still providing detailed information when needed.</p>
        <p>Each project entry in the items section has a collapsed state that only displays the title, year, and basic details. When the toggle button is clicked, a JavaScript function expands the row, revealing a more in-depth description, images, and additional context. Clicking again collapses the entry, keeping the interface streamlined and preventing information overload.</p>
        <p>The JavaScript behind this feature ensures that multiple toggles can be opened simultaneously while preventing conflicts between different items. It also uses smooth animations to make the transition between expanded and collapsed states visually appealing.</p>
        
        <h2>Carousel and Timeline Animations</h2>
        <p>Urban Dream also incorporates dynamic elements such as a timeline animation and an image carousel, which make the exhibition feel more engaging.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The historical timeline uses JavaScript to track scroll position and animate elements as they enter the viewport. This creates a parallax effect, making each entry appear dynamically instead of being displayed all at once.</li>
            <li>The carousel feature, present in the exhibition section, cycles through different architectural concepts. JavaScript ensures that images rotate smoothly and pause on hover, allowing users to focus on details without losing navigation control.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Responsiveness and Mobile Adaptation</h2>
        <p>Urban Dream is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring smooth functionality across devices. JavaScript plays a role in adjusting layouts dynamically, detecting screen sizes, and modifying element behaviors accordingly.</p>
        <p>Some examples of this adaptation include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dropdown menus that collapse into mobile-friendly versions</li>
            <li>The timeline transitioning from a horizontal format (desktop) to a vertical format (mobile)</li>
            <li>Touch-friendly interactions for mobile users, ensuring smooth scrolling and tapping instead of requiring precise clicks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Media queries in CSS handle most of the visual adjustments, but JavaScript ensures that interactive elements function properly across different devices.</p>
        
        <h2>Error Handling and Performance Optimization</h2>
        <p>Since the exhibition contains a large dataset of projects, optimization is crucial to maintaining performance. JavaScript is used to minimize unnecessary reloading and optimize rendering by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using lazy loading for images so that they load only when needed</li>
            <li>Storing frequently accessed data in JavaScript objects, reducing redundant computations</li>
            <li>Implementing debounce functions in filtering to prevent excessive processing when users click rapidly</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To handle potential errors (e.g., missing images, broken links, or unexpected inputs), JavaScript includes fail-safe mechanisms that display fallback content when needed.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The functionality of Urban Dream is what truly brings the exhibition to life, transforming it from a static collection of architectural concepts into an interactive research and exploration tool. JavaScript drives real-time filtering, interactive mapping, dynamic toggling, and smooth animations, ensuring that users can engage with the content in a fluid and engaging way.</p>
        <p>By integrating these features seamlessly, Urban Dream not only showcases radical architecture but also invites users to actively participate in discovering and analyzing visionary urban concepts. The combination of a well-structured dataset, intuitive navigation, and interactive components makes this digital exhibition an engaging experience that goes beyond traditional architectural documentation.</p>
