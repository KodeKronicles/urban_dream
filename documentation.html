                            <p>
                        The homepage follows a minimalistic yet engaging design to balance aesthetics and usability.
                        A flowing grid animation showcases our chosen objects in a subtle yet catchy way. The lowered opacity
                        ensures that while the images catch the eye, they do not distract from the overall experience.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Below the main section, a brief ‘About’ section provides context for the project’s purpose, followed by
                        an engaging timeline that highlights key urban planning milestones. At the very bottom, a map along with
                        the museum's opening hours guides the user, and the footer features a clickable GitHub logo linking to the
                        project repository.
                      </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="structure">

                            <h1>Content Structure</h1>
                            <h2>Site architecture</h2>
                      <p>The architecture of the website is designed to guide users through a virtual exhibition, with each page being designed for an intuitive experience.</p>
                      <h3>Navigation bar</h3>
                      <p>The anchoring point between all pages is a simple navigation bar, with a version that is slightly different visually being prepared for the home page for more visual distinction.</p>
                      <p>On the left side of the navbar, we have placed the logo of the project, which also doubles as a home page button. On its' right side, there are five links, to Home, Exhibition, Map, Items and About pages respectively.</p>
                      <p>The five-item list on the right transforms into a hamburger-button list on smaller widths to accommodate mobile devices.</p>
                      <h3>Home page</h3>
                      <p>The home page serves as an introduction to the virtual exhibitions, with the images of all the items presented via a three-row horizontal parallax scrolling div. Below it, a vertical timeline introducing the chief advancements in urbanism is presented. The home page culminates with a map showing the location of the exhibition and the opening pages.</p>
                      <h3>Exhibition</h3>
                      <p>The exhibition page serves as further introduction to the topic of the exhibition. There are five groups of items, further divided into subgroups (eg. location -> Europe). Clicking an item here redirects to a page containing its longest description.</p>
                      <h3>Map</h3>
                      <p>The map page is divided into two parts; the map proper, and the list of all items on exhibition. The map contains 20 clickable elements, each corresponding to an exhibition item, which filter the underlying list to show just one item.</p>
                      <p>The list contains all 20 exhibition items with 6 attributes, on which the list can be sorted. Clicking an item extends a tab with additional information, both visual and textual, and an external link for further reference.</p>
                      <h3>Item viewer</h3>
                      <p>The item viewer page presents images and metadata of all exhibition items. There is one image per item, and its' display on the page is standardised. The item metadata contains information about time, place, type and clickable links to narratives. In the same section, below the metadata table, there are two button groups; the first one for changing the displayed item in the current narrative to next/previous, and the second for indicating and toggling between items in the current narrative.</p>
                      <p>The section below contains textual information about the items, and the buttons to display more/less information.</p>
                      <h3>Footer</h3>
                      <p>The page contains a simple footer, showing the copyright and a link to the GitHub repository containing the project.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h2>Layout</h2>
                      <p>
                        The homepage layout embraces a minimalistic design with a clear timeline guiding users through historical
                        urban planning milestones. A grey vertical block is strategically positioned slightly to the left of the
                        flowing grid, ensuring that the project name remains prominent while the imagery is allowed to breathe.
                      </p>
                      <h2>Grid Layout and Spacing</h2>
                      <h3><b>Bootstrap Containers:</b></h3>
                      <ul>

                        <li>A combination of <code>col-md-2</code> for side elements and <code>col-md-10</code> for main content
                          balances proportions and maintains an intuitive navigation flow.</li>
                        <li>Bootstrap's grid system facilitates responsiveness by adjusting layouts based on screen width.</li>

                        <li>Fixed units (<code>px</code>, <code>rem</code>) are used for elements requiring precise control,
                          such as border widths and icons.</li>
                        <li>Relative units (<code>%</code>, <code>em</code>, <code>vh</code>, <code>vw</code>) enhance flexibility,
                          ensuring smooth layout adaptation across devices.</li>
                        <li>Margins and paddings are carefully structured to avoid visual clutter while maintaining alignment and
                          readability.</li>

                      <h3>Recurring Percentages:</h3>
                      <ul>
                        <li><strong>7%</strong> for larger section separations, centering content and ensuring visual hierarchy.</li>
                        <li><strong>5%</strong> for moderate spacing within content containers, maintaining readability and structure.</li>
                        <li><strong>3%</strong> for tighter spacing, particularly between text and images, optimizing information
                          density without overwhelming the user.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <h2>Typography and Colors</h2>
                      <h3>Fonts:</h3>
                      <ul>
                        <li><strong>Inter</strong> – used for the navbar and general text, ensuring readability and a modern look.</li>

                      <p>
                        The homepage follows a minimalistic yet engaging design to balance aesthetics and usability.
                        A flowing grid animation showcases our chosen objects in a subtle yet catchy way. The lowered opacity
                        ensures that while the images catch the eye, they do not distract from the overall experience.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Below the main section, a brief ‘About’ section provides context for the project’s purpose, followed by
                        an engaging timeline that highlights key urban planning milestones. At the very bottom, a map along with
                        the museum's opening hours guides the user, and the footer features a clickable GitHub logo linking to the
                        project repository.

                      <h2>Site architecture</h2>
                      <p>The architecture of the website is designed to guide users through a virtual exhibition, with each page being designed for an intuitive experience.</p>
                      <h3>Navigation bar</h3>
                      <p>The anchoring point between all pages is a simple navigation bar, with a version that is slightly different visually being prepared for the home page for more visual distinction.</p>
                      <p>On the left side of the navbar, we have placed the logo of the project, which also doubles as a home page button. On its' right side, there are five links, to Home, Exhibition, Map, Items and About pages respectively.</p>
                      <p>The five-item list on the right transforms into a hamburger-button list on smaller widths to accommodate mobile devices.</p>
                      <h3>Home page</h3>
                      <p>The home page serves as an introduction to the virtual exhibitions, with the images of all the items presented via a three-row horizontal parallax scrolling div. Below it, a vertical timeline introducing the chief advancements in urbanism is presented. The home page culminates with a map showing the location of the exhibition and the opening pages.</p>
                      <h3>Exhibition</h3>
                      <p>The exhibition page serves as further introduction to the topic of the exhibition. There are five groups of items, further divided into subgroups (eg. location -> Europe). Clicking an item here redirects to a page containing its longest description.</p>
                      <h3>Map</h3>
                      <p>The map page is divided into two parts; the map proper, and the list of all items on exhibition. The map contains 20 clickable elements, each corresponding to an exhibition item, which filter the underlying list to show just one item.</p>
                      <p>The list contains all 20 exhibition items with 6 attributes, on which the list can be sorted. Clicking an item extends a tab with additional information, both visual and textual, and an external link for further reference.</p>
                      <h3>Item viewer</h3>
                      <p>The item viewer page presents images and metadata of all exhibition items. There is one image per item, and its' display on the page is standardised. The copyright for each image is provide in its lower right corner. The item metadata contains information about time, place, type and clickable links to narratives. In the same section, below the metadata table, there are two button groups; the first one for changing the displayed item in the current narrative to next/previous, and the second for indicating and toggling between items in the current narrative.</p>
                      <p>The section below contains textual information about the items, and the buttons to display more/less information.</p>
                      <h3>Footer</h3>
                      <p>The page contains a simple footer, showing the copyright and a link to the GitHub repository containing the project.</p>
                    </div>

                      <h2>Layout</h2>
                      <p>
                        The homepage layout embraces a minimalistic design with a clear timeline guiding users through historical
                        urban planning milestones. A grey vertical block is strategically positioned slightly to the left of the
                        flowing grid, ensuring that the project name remains prominent while the imagery is allowed to breathe.
                      </p>
                      <h2>Grid Layout and Spacing</h2>
                      <h3><b>Bootstrap Containers:</b></h3>
                      <ul>
                        <li>The <code>container-fluid</code> class ensures full-width adaptability, optimizing space usage.</li>
                        <li>A combination of <code>col-md-2</code> for side elements and <code>col-md-10</code> for main content
                          balances proportions and maintains an intuitive navigation flow.</li>
                        <li>Bootstrap's grid system facilitates responsiveness by adjusting layouts based on screen width.</li>

                        <li>Fixed units (<code>px</code>, <code>rem</code>) are used for elements requiring precise control,
                          such as border widths and icons.</li>
                        <li>Relative units (<code>%</code>, <code>em</code>, <code>vh</code>, <code>vw</code>) enhance flexibility,
                          ensuring smooth layout adaptation across devices.</li>
                        <li>Margins and paddings are carefully structured to avoid visual clutter while maintaining alignment and
                          readability.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <h3>Recurring Percentages:</h3>

                        <li><strong>5%</strong> for moderate spacing within content containers, maintaining readability and structure.</li>
                        <li><strong>3%</strong> for tighter spacing, particularly between text and images, optimizing information
                          density without overwhelming the user.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <h2>Typography and Colors</h2>
                      <h3>Fonts:</h3>
                      <ul>
                        <li><strong>Inter</strong> – used for the navbar and general text, ensuring readability and a modern look.</li>
